## 🌟 Key Features

* **Advanced Predictive Engine:** CatBoost Regressor utilizing multi-season historical data, dynamic driver forms, and circuit-specific metrics.
* **Premium Paddock UI:** High-end dark telemetry dashboard layout featuring minimalist 3D podium cards, interactive hover glows, and precise grid layouts built using custom CSS overrides.
* **Optimized Asset Pipeline:** Smart-routed driver portrait streams and sandboxed inline **Base64 binary team logo streams** to completely bypass cross-origin network hotlinking blocks.
* **Dynamic Form Factors:** Multi-year support with robust fallback mapping mechanisms for missing data points or sudden driver changes.

## 📊 System Architecture & Data Pipeline

The system is engineered as a decoupled, multi-stage data processing and machine learning pipeline:

1. **Ingestion Layer:** Pulls historical and real-time session telemetry, qualifying results, and driver/constructor metrics using the `FastF1` API and historical data matrices.
2. **Feature Engineering Engine:** Computes dynamic rolling form metrics (e.g., driver's average finish position over the last $N$ races, team constructor velocity).
3. **Inference Pipeline:** Loads the optimized CatBoost model bundle (`f1_model_v3.pkl`), validates structural schema inputs, and outputs full predicted race standings.
4. **Presentation Layer:** Renders a sandboxed high-performance layout on Streamlit Cloud utilizing low-latency base64 graphics injection.
